# Live Photo and Motion Photo playground on browser

A SPA online tool that converted and compressed [live photo](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/live-photos) and [motion photo](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/motion-photo-format?hl=zh-cn) for web scenario. Or you can preview any image - video (e.g. jpg and mp4 files) pair as live photo on your browser with the aid of [LivePhotosKit JS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/livephotoskitjs). Any PRs are welcomed.

âœ¨ Main features:

1. Recognition and preview motion photo series jpg files (google/xiaomi/oppo).
2. Convert or Reduce media (pixel, cut, mute..) by ffmpeg wasm (single/multithread).
3. Take snapshot of video as static image of motion photo and custom presentation timestamp.
4. Recreate motion photo jpg file from above with ability to custom XMP meta.
4. Download, and Upload with flexible API of all above.
5. Realtime logs.
6. Save configs locally.
7. Heic/heif image supported, you should export heic/jpg and mov file from iphone before import.
8. Multi-language and dark theme.

UI inspired by [video-dark2light-ffmpeg](https://github.com/The-Best-Codes/video-dark2light-ffmpeg). The motion photo parse and generate algorithm was derived from [https://motion-photo-parser.site.0to1.cf](https://motion-photo-parser.site.0to1.cf/). Heic/heif file compatibility drived by [heic-to](https://github.com/hoppergee/heic-to).
